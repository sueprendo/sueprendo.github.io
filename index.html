   <h2 id=pagetitle>Coding and video editing</h2>
      
      <p>This webpage was coded using HTML5 and CSS3 for practice purposes. I'm working on eventually creating and deploying a website where I can play and practice using some of the latest tools and tech. </p>
      
    <h2 id=pagetitle>Why though?</h2>      
          
      <p>Learning to code with front end programming languages is one of those multi-beneficial endeavours that will help me to learn more about computer technology while allowing me to make and create tangible work simultaneously. Not only does it satisfy my own itch to learn and create, it will also bring many benefits to our eLearning development processes such as:</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>better problem solving and troubleshooting skills</li>
      <li>a better understanding of variables and triggers</li>
      <li>the potential for more customized eLearning developed in popular development tools</li>
      <li>the ability to understand and use open-source development tools</li>
      <li>the ability to program static websites and eventually more complicated websites and apps</li>
      <li>honed crossover skills and process knowledge</li>
      <li>making use of programming resources, frameworks and online communities to code and develop more efficiently </li></ul>
          
    <h2 id=pagetitle>Video editing</h2> 
      
      <p>Along with coding, I also wanted to play around with interactive video. I feel if you get it right, it can elicit the feeling of augmented reality - another technology that will be a game changer for training!</p>

      <p>I partnered with my husband to test out wirewax using drone footage of the mowing and blowing bunker detailing at his golf course. I wanted the staff and equipment in the video to be clickable in order for the user to get more information on the piece of equipment being used. Play the following video and click on the pulsing hotspots:</p>

            <iframe width="480" height="270" src="http://embed.wirewax.com/8066745/" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe> -->
      
      <p>There are lots of elements to be tidyed up such as the hotspot tracking, copy editing, video editing and instruction. I just wanted to have a minimum viable product to show how it can be used! After making the video interactive, we discussed the potential for creating interactive training videos and task descriptions at the golf course. </p> <br/>
      
      <p>Overall, wirewax was mostly easy to use for this purpose. It was a bit finicky, slow to fix tracking, and you have to pay for various feature upgrades, but it was useful. Here are some other ways you can use it for eLearning:</p> <br/>
